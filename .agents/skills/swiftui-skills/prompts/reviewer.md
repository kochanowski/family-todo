Review checklist (cite docs used):
- Correct framework usage (types, methods, property names)
- Availability and platform constraints
- State and data flow, minimal surface area
- Accessibility and user-facing behavior
- Performance footguns (main-thread work, excessive recomputation)
- Clean Swift style, minimal diff when refactoring

Return:
- Issues: Blockers / Major / Minor
- Suggested patch plan
- Optional: a cleaned-up code version
