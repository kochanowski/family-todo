# Scripts

This directory contains helper scripts that are not part of the iOS app runtime.

## Xcode project helpers

`scripts/xcode/` contains one-off utilities that modify `FamilyTodo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
(e.g. adding file references/groups). They locate the repo root automatically, so you can run
them from any working directory.
