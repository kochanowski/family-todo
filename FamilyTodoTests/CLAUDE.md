# Development Environment

**IMPORTANT:** Development happens on Manjaro Linux - xcodebuild is NOT available locally.

- Tests are run on GitHub Actions (macOS runner)
- Local validation: `pre-commit run --all-files` (validates project structure)
- To test changes: push to GitHub and check CI results
